Toptal Project

Description - 

Project is done using C++/Qt libraries.

This project consists of two main programs, Zone_Client and Zone_Server. Zone_Client communicates with Zone_Server via  REST api. Zone_Client is used  to store timezone details. Zone_Client uses Qt widgets for its UI. Zone_Server uses Tufao Http server for HTTP communications and a sqlite DB for storing data. Zone_Server can operate in either HTTP mode or HTTPS mode depending on a build variable.

SignUp - Users can sign up to a new account. They can request themselves to be an Admin user, which they can alter other users

Signin - After signing operation, the client will be given a authentication token which need to be used in API calls after that. Operations include, 
	sync data
	modify user
	delete user
	sign out

Sync data - Client data is synced with server DB. This will be called when user is signed out and main program is closed.

Modify/delete user - Admin users can modify/delete all users while non-admin users can modify/delete their accounts only
